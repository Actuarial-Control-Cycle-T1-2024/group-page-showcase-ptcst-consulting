## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of the Life Insurance company and can be measured by key metrics including:
- mortality rates of policyholders
- expected policy profits
- new business signups
- expected death payouts

These metrics will be continuously monitored over time, with the program being reviewed every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving these main objectives, and modify the program's features and/or pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
PTCST Consulting developed a comprehensive health incentive program for SuperLife that incentivises participation by offering external benefits through a rewards scheme, and policy-related benefits through premium reductions.

_Features_
Taking a more personalised approach to the wellness plan, each new policyholder over the age of 25 will undergo an initial, compulsory health and heart check-up, that will form the basis of their personalised health plan. This personalised health plan will include some or all of the following program features, and will be revised each year, based on the results of the policyholder’s annual health check-up:

1.	Annual Health Check-ups:
  •	Comprehensive annual health check-up (and immediately for all new policyholders) that provides free or discounted health screenings for various conditions, including blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, and diabetes screenings
  •	Used to develop personalised health plan

2.	Heart Health Screenings: 
  •	Offer to policyholders to gauge risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years
    o	Use to develop features of personalised health plan, e.g., following a heart-healthy eating pattern, increasing exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing tobacco use
  	•	For all policyholder ages to complete annually upon purchasing a policy

4.	Cancer Prevention Initiatives:
  •	Personalised based on policyholder’s lifestyle factors, including diet, tobacco use, physical activity.
    o	offer personalised educational resources on lifestyle improvements and its effect on reducing cancer risk
  •	Provide access to genetic testing for policyholders with a family history of cancer

5.	Discounted Gym Memberships:
  •	Partner with large franchise gym centres to offer discounted gym memberships to policyholders’ closest local gym
  •	Provide access to virtual fitness classes and online workout programs for policyholders who elect to exercise at home

6.	Weight Management Programs:
  •	Develop personalised weight management program, with potential aspects of:
    o	Dietitian appointments
    o	Healthy cooking classes
    o	Healthy eating workshops

7.	Safety Campaigns:
  •	Provide both general and personalised safety workshops, based on policyholder’s profile, that aim to promote healthy living and injury prevention
  •	General workshops and webinars on fire safety, home safety and safe driving
  •	Create personalised (i.e., by industry) workplace safety campaigns that offers tips on work stress management, ergonomic practices and key safety techniques, e.g., proper lifting practices for policyholders with manual labour jobs

### Appendix A: Intervention Program Selection Methdology 
1. Sorted ​​program descriptions (in given data) to maximise impact on mortality rates whilst simultaneously minimising per capita cost of the scheme
2. Plotted and identified leading causes of death (using given data) and mapped these to the associated intervention schemes
3. Determined top schemes with maximal impact on mortality rates and minimal per capita cost that can be directly linked to mitigate the leading causes of death
