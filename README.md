## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of SuperLife and will be measured by the following key metrics:
| Key Metric | Frequency |
|------------|-----------|
| Mortality Rates of Policyholders | Annually for first 5 years, then once every 5 years |
| Expected Death Payouts | Annually |
| Number of New Business Signups | Annually |
| Expected Policy Profits & Costs | Annually |
| Satisfaction Rate (Net Promoter Score) | Annually for the first 5 years, then once every 5 years |

Given these metrics, the wellness program will be reviewed as a whole every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving its main objectives, and modify the program's features and/or pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
PTCST Consulting developed a comprehensive health incentive program for SuperLife that incentivises participation by offering profit-sharing opportunities.

**Features**

PTCST Consulting’s wellness plan uses a tailored approach whereby each new SuperLife policyholder over the age of 25 will undergo an initial, compulsory health check-up which forms the basis of their personalised health plan. This personalised health plan will include some or all of the listed program features and will be revised each year, based on the results of the policyholder’s annual compulsory health check-up and heart screening:

1.	Annual Health Check-ups:
     - Comprehensive annual health check-up (and immediately for all new policyholders) that provides free or discounted health screenings for various conditions, including blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, and diabetes screenings
     - Used to develop personalised health plan

2.	Heart Health Screenings:
     - Offer to policyholders to gauge risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years
     - Use to develop features of personalised health plan, e.g., following a heart-healthy eating pattern, increasing exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing tobacco use
     - For all policyholder ages to complete annually upon purchasing a policy

3.	Cancer Prevention Initiatives:
     - Personalised based on policyholder’s lifestyle factors, including diet, tobacco use, physical activity.
     - Offer personalised educational resources on lifestyle improvements and its effect on reducing cancer risk
     - Provide access to genetic testing for policyholders with a family history of cancer

4.	Discounted Gym Memberships:
     - Partner with large franchise gym centres to offer discounted gym memberships to policyholders’ closest local gym
     - Provide access to virtual fitness classes and online workout programs for policyholders who elect to exercise at home

5.	Weight Management Programs:
     - Develop personalised weight management program, with potential aspects of:
         - Dietitian appointments
         - Healthy cooking classes
         - Healthy eating workshops

6.	Safety Campaigns:
     - Provide both general and personalised safety workshops, based on policyholders' profiles, that aim to promote healthy living and injury prevention
     - General workshops and webinars on fire safety, home safety and safe driving
     - Create personalised (i.e., by industry) workplace safety campaigns that offers tips on work stress management, ergonomic practices and key safety techniques, e.g., proper lifting techniques for policyholders with manual labour jobs

**Incentives for Intervention Program**

SuperLife’s incentive scheme is underpinned by a multi-level reward system, where policyholders progress by completing goals in their personalised health plan, e.g. participating in safety workshops. This system is split into five levels, each with different proportions of profit share allocated to policyholders, who start on Level 1 upon sign-up (see _Table A_). 

Each year, in the annual check-up and heart screening, the policyholder will receive certain health goals from the medical practitioner, such as BMI requirements, target heart-rate or ideal cholesterol levels. At the policyholder’s next annual check-up and heart screening:
- If the policyholder has met (not met) the previous policy year’s goals, they move up (down) a level in the incentive scheme structure for the next year. Moving to higher (lower) levels leads to increased (decreased) proportions of profit share.

|        | **Level 1** | **Level 2** | **Level 3** | **Level 4** | **Level 5** |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Profit Share Allocation** | 10% | 15% | 20% | 30% | 10%|

_Table A: Profit Share Allocation Structure_

**Other Key Program Requirements**
- Policyholders must agree to participate in initial and annual health and heart check-ups to track personal progress and improvements.
- Policyholders must be committed to making lifestyle changes and implementing healthy habits to improve overall wellness.
- Policyholders must be willing to honestly share their progress with SuperLife to qualify for incentives.
- Policyholders must agree to participate in NPS feedback surveys to provide input and improve the program for future participants.

**Justification of Program Features**:

_Qualitative_:
1.	Lower frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts by…
  - Decreasing Expected Mortality: through the overall development of healthy behaviours, the program aims to reduce the likelihood of
    policyholders’ mortality.
2. Incentivises Healthy Behaviour through…
  - Participation in the Program: material rewards system uses gamification elements, such as progressing to higher reward tiers, to motivates
    policyholders to make lasting health changes
  - Social support aspect of program features, such as group healthy cooking or exercise classes, encourages engagement and make it easily
    accessible
3.	Increases SuperLife’s overall profitability by…
  - Increasing Life Insurance Sales: rewards and discounts offered through the program will incentivise participants to purchase SuperLife’s life
    insurance products, thereby increasing sales and revenue
  - Improving Product Marketability and Competitiveness: this holistic health plan will differentiate SuperLife’s offerings in the market, making
    them more attractive to consumers
  - Adding Economic Value to SuperLife: By promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing mortality rates, the program ultimately increases sales,
    customer loyalty and long-term customer relations
    
_Quantitative_:
Intervention Program Selection Methodology conducted to determine the most optimal intervention programs to include (refer to _Appendix A_ for further details):
1. Sorted program descriptions (in given data) to maximise impact on mortality rates whilst simultaneously minimising per capita cost of the scheme
2. Plotted and identified leading causes of death (using given data) and mapped these to the associated intervention schemes
3. Determined top schemes with maximal impact on mortality rates and minimal per capita cost that can be directly linked to mitigate the leading causes of death

**Justification of Short-and-Long-term Timeframes**
- Short-term timeframe is the 5-year period from 2023 (2023–2028)
  
Evaluating the wellness program within the next 5 years is a sufficient amount of time for SuperLife to start seeing the impact on mortality rates, but not too extensive so as to allow them to adjust the program if needed, based on feedback and results, to ensure it achieves the project goals.

- Long-term timeframe of the 30-year period from 2023 (2023-2053)
  
SuperLife offers products such as whole life, 20- and 30-year term insurance, and universal life products and hence have long-term implications for policyholders. Hence, this timeframe allows Superlife to recognise the long-term benefits in terms of lower mortality rates and higher customer retention.


## Pricing/Costs
**Method**
_Generating Parameters_

To generate the model parameters, the uniform distribution was used to generate a vector of TRUE/FALSE entries that represent whether each policyholder meets their annual health goals or not, with policyholders generating TRUE, being referred to as “Goal Meet-ers”. The uniform distribution was then used to generate the cost of each policyholder’s personalised program, with the full value of the individual programs added to SuperLife’s expenses. Then, using the multivariate normal distribution, mortality benefits were generated for each policyholder, based on their individual set of intervention programs. For policyholders not classified as “Goal Meet-ers”, effects derived from their intervention programs were excluded.

_Calculations for Decrements_

A lapse table and mortality table were created by considering policyholders’ lapse rate and mortality rate, respectively, as the duration of the policy increased. For mortality tables, graduation was then applied using standard life tables by fitting a linear regression. This approximation was sufficient for the male population (pop.), although further approximation was required for more realistic female mortality (mort.) values, using the formula:

Standard Mort.Total Pop.= Male Mort.Male Pop.+Female Mort.Female Pop.

_Expenses and Expected Death Cost Calculations_ 

Expenses and expected death costs were calculated for each policyholder, for each policy year:
1. Calculate mortality reductions for policy year, according to:
   New Mortality Rate = Old Mortality Rate  (1 - Mortality Reduction)
2. Calculate cumulative survival probability to that point from age at date of issue
   Survival Probability = 1 - Lapse Probability - Death Probability
3. Multiply the expenses associated with policyholders’ individualised health programs by the cumulative survival up to that point
4. Multiply policyholders’ cumulative survival by death probability and face amount to find expected death costs


_Basis for Premium Pricing_

Pricing methodology is centred on first determining total expenses and expected death costs, then determining the required premiums to cover those costs and generate a specified profit margin. To determine the amount of the total required premium each policyholder should undertake, the concept of “risk units” is applied, whereby the annual premium for a single risk unit is determined, then depending on each policyholder’s individual characteristics, the quantity of risk units they must purchase for each $1000 of sum insured is determined. This is used to find equitable proportions of total premiums paid by each policyholder, and price estimations. See Appendix 7.4.1 for the risk unit determination methodology. 

After obtaining these risk units, standard valuation calculations were made, replacing premium values with Total Risk Units P, where P represents the price of a single risk unit. Finally, P was solved based on specified profit margins (see Results section).

_Valuation and Zeroisation_

The amount of required reserves each year to make the wellness program self-financing was determined by the equation:
Reserves(t) = Premiums(t) - Expenses(t) - Expected Death Costs(t)

Final cash flows were then discounted by 5% (see Assumptions) to determine the NPV.

## Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key variables (see _Appendix D_ for tested values) to assess the financial impact of changes in key assumptions. Ranges of values were determined for each of the above variables, with the theoretical experience assumptions lying within this range. A comparison of the absolute impacts on SuperLife’s net present value and the relative impacts on profit margin for the best and worst case scenarios for each variable was conducted. The profit margin comparison is illustrated in _Figure B_ below. See _Appendix D_ for the NPV comparison and an in-depth analysis of the sensitivity results.

_Figure B: Sensitivity Analysis - Profit Margin_

Evidently, the effect of the intervention programs on mortality rates will have the largest impact on SuperLife’s profit margin. The outer bounds of each intervention program’s approximate impact on mortality rates was used, where the upper bound generates the best case scenario and the lower bound generates the worst case scenario. Given the results, it is important for SuperLife to closely monitor and update the mortality rate improvement assumptions regularly, as the worst case scenario results in a 14% decrease in the profit margin.

Additionally, to showcase the interplay of these changing assumptions, the evaluation of a specific scenario was conducted (see Appendix 7.5.3 for tested values):
- **Natural Disaster** (scenario): A decrease in supply of agricultural products due to major droughts which reduces crop yields and production, causing a significant decline in exports and income for individuals in Lumaria working in the agriculture sector.
     - _Lower Mortality Improvements_: export volume decreases could lead to a decrease in revenue, hence limiting resources to invest in healthcare. This could result in lower quality of healthcare services, leading to higher mortality rates.
     - _Lower Goal-Meeting Rate_: Lower mortality improvements and correlation may correspond to less policyholders meeting goals.
     - _Increased Program Costs:_ economic decline causes higher prices for programs, especially non-essential ones. 
     - _Lower Interest-Rate_: due to lower economic activity.
     - _Lower Sign-Up Rate_: lower income and possible layoffs in the agricultural sector may result in lower spending, hence less likely to take out insurance.

**Qualitative Risks (L)**
| Risk | Explanation | Risk Matrix Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| L1. Program may be perceived as intrusive | Policyholders may feel that SuperLife’s access to their health data and the level of monitoring is intrusive leading to potential customers hesitating to purchase a life insurance policy with them. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensuring there is transparency surrounding what health data will be used and how individuals will be monitored.</li><li>Ensuring that only the minimum required data is collected to complete the required work.</li><li>Providing options for policyholders to refrain from sharing certain data if they would like to keep it private.</li><li>Emphasising the benefits of participating so that they know their data is being used in their best interests</li></ul>|
| L2. Dependence on Technology | It is likely that there will be a lot of technology used for monitoring purposes throughout the program. Some policyholders (e.g., the elderly population) may not have sufficient digital literacy leading to accessibility issues amongst different age groups. | 20 (Very High) | <ul><li>Provide good customer service and technology support.</li><li>Ensure a user friendly interface and clear instructions.</li></ul>|
| L3. Exploitation of loopholes | Policyholders may exploit loopholes in the health program if monitoring is not stringent enough or if the completion of the program activities are easy to forge. E.g., if there is a daily requirement of 1000 steps, the policyholder could just attach their step counter device to their dog. | 6 (Moderate) | <ul><li>Define clear rules and criteria regarding what constitutes the completion/progression of the health program.</li><li>Carefully consider possible loopholes when developing the healthcare plan.</li><li>Monitor policyholder engagement patterns and investigate any suspicious activity.</li></ul>|
| L4. Regulatory Compliance Risk | Using policyholder health data and constant health monitoring to determine e.g., premium reductions may be violating Lumarian regulations. | 20 (High) | <ul><li>Utilise regulatory and legal advisors whilst developing the program to ensure there is compliance to all relevant laws.</li><li>Conduct frequent audits to ensure ongoing compliance especially when there are changes to regulations.</li></ul>|
| L5. Employee Resistance | Implementing a health program like this would require more work from employees since there would be more inquiries from policyholders and more information would need to be provided to customers. This concept is new so it would take quite a bit of work on the employees’ part to help customers understand and feel secure. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Since more employees will need to be hired, make sure to hire individuals who are supportive of the program and its objectives.</li><li>Provide comprehensive training, guidance and resources so that they understand the program and its benefits.</li><li>Incentivise frontline workers to promote the new products.</li></ul>|
| L6. Policyholders not adopting healthy behaviours | The policyholders may not adopt healthy behaviours in which case the program wouldn’t be that effective and the high initial costs to implement the program may not be compensated by decreased mortality in the future. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensure participation incentives are sufficient to motivate participation. This could be done by conducting surveys and exploring existing data from other health care plans.</li><li>Providing tailored programs taking into account barriers to change and mitigating those accordingly.</li><li>Ensure that the policyholder understands the short and long term benefits of adherence.</li></ul>|
| L7. Competitive Rivalry | Other insurance companies may implement similar health programs creating competition for SuperLife. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensure that the program being provided by SuperLife has some differentiating aspect that isn’t easy to replicate, e.g., SuperLife could have an exclusive supply partnership with some other companies to provide unique incentives to policyholders.</li><li>Monitor the competition landscape continuously and ensure the program continues to have a differentiating factor and is reasonably priced.</li></ul>|
| L8. Privacy Concerns | There is risk of privacy being breached. | 16 (Very High) | <ul><li>Ensure compliance with the relevant regulators. </li><li>Conduct frequent audits.</li><li>Create appropriate access controls and encryption.</li><li>Only collect the minimum data necessary to complete the required work.</li></ul>|

**Quantitative Risks (T)**
| Risk | Explanation | Risk Matrix Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| T1. Underestimation of Program Costs | The total initial and ongoing costs of the program may be underestimated leading to unforeseen expenses and challenges to maintain the program. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Conduct thorough analysis of all potential costs including admin, incentive payouts, marketing, new employee salaries, training, etc.</li><li>Regularly update cost projections depending on inflation.</li><li>Ensure there are reserves to buffer unexpected costs.</li><li>Conduct sensitivity analysis to determine what would be an appropriate amount of reserves.</li></ul>| 
| T2. Inaccurate Health Assessments (Counterparty Risk) | There is a possibility that third-party vendors and healthcare providers conduct inaccurate health assessments leading to mispricing of premiums or not providing the most effective incentives. | 8 (High) | <ul><li>Conduct due diligence on selected counterparty’s experience and expertise.</li><li>Define clear performance metrics.</li><li>Monitor and audit the performance of the counterparty.</li></ul>| 
| T3. Adverse Selection | Individuals with higher health risks may be more likely to sign up to the program leading to higher claims and increased losses to SuperLife. | 16 (Very High) | <ul><li>Ensure high risk individuals are filtered out during the health assessment process using well defined underwriting guidelines.</li><li>Monitor the risk profile of individuals and make sure to adjust their premiums and incentives accordingly.</li></ul>| 
| T4. Model Selection Risk | Potentially selecting an inadequate modelling for projecting the program outcomes leading to inaccurate predictions or biases. | 9 (High) | <ul><li>Understand the data and use suitable assumptions.</li><li>Compare models.</li><li>Evaluate model performance using metrics such as AIC/BIC and R-squared.</li><li>Update assumptions and model as the program evolves.</li></ul>| 
| T5. Economic Assumptions Risk | Economic factors such as inflation and interest rates can be highly volatile. Because of this, any assumptions about these rates are likely to be incorrect leading to false projections and revenue forecasts. | 25 (Very High) | <ul><li>Assume constant inflation and interest rate since the high volatility of these factors means there is no added benefit or projecting these.</li><li>Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess economic scenario impact.</li><li>Regularly update economic assumptions.</li></ul>|
| T6. Liquidity Risk | There may be inadequate liquidity to fund payouts and meet other financial obligations especially during the first few years of implementing the program. | 15 (Very High) | <ul><li>Conduct stress testing and cash-flow analysis.</li><li>Organise contingency funding arrangements e.g., reinsurance.</li><li>Monitor liquidity metrics regularly.</li></ul>|


## Data and Data Limitations
**Data**

No external data was used for the analysis. 


**Data Limitations**
| Limitation                   | Explanation                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of homogeneity between insured population vs. general population | The SuperLife Inforce data set (2023 cohort) has been used as a representative sample of payout reduction for prospective policies. However, the selection effects of the differences between the insured population versus the general population (_Appendix C_) may compromise the accuracy of our analysis. |
| Lack of gender differentiation in mortality table data | The discrepancies between female and male life expectancies in reality should be reflected in differences in their mortality rates. However, the mortality table does not distinguish between the two genders and thus, generalises our analysis by combining both genders.|
| Limited past policy data | The truncation of the SuperLife Inforce dataset to 2001 blocks insight into possible longitudinal and cross-sectional trends, thus reducing the precision of future projections by introducing unaccounted variance. |
| Limited data on Lumaria’s population trend | The lack of data on Lumaria’s population trend has made it difficult to extrapolate calculations. This had led to the assumptions of a closed population and a linear trend in mortality improvement. |
| No data on policy premiums | Exact policy premiums were not provided. Hence, premiums were estimated based on the Principle of Equivalence, which compromises the accuracy of the estimated cash inflows. |
| Historical economic data | Historical inflation rates, interest rates and spot rates were used to project future rates, thus compromising the accuracy of projected future revenue and costs. |

## Further Recommendations
It is essential to ensure the wellness program is easily accessible to policyholders to ensure full health benefits and optimal satisfaction. SuperLife must ensure that the wellness program does not unfairly discriminate against policyholders based on factors such as age, gender, or location. SuperLife may consider offering virtual or online resources as a reasonable location adjustment, such as mobile apps, telehealth services, or virtual wellness events. 

The use of policyholder data to evaluate the impact of the wellness program is essential for measuring effectiveness and making informed decisions for future improvements. However, for ethical purposes, SuperLife should consider implementing transparent data collecting and analysis processes, with data only being used to measure the effectiveness of the program and make improvements for the future benefit of policyholders. 

Furthermore, to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws, SuperLife should consider providing clear information about the program, including costs, benefits and potential risks to policyholders, and not engage in unfair or deceptive practices. Ongoing reporting, monitoring of reserves and regular cost updates to regulators should be provided to ensure compliance.

## Conclusion
To conclude, the proposed wellness intervention program can help SuperLife improve its policyholders’ expected mortality whilst also achieving increased profitability (RESULTS…..). After thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses on the impact of the wellness program over short and long-term timeframes and under assumptions scenarios, the improved financial and social benefits associated with the scheme provide substantial evidence that the project should be undertaken given our assumptions. Although the analyses conducted in this report justify the implementation of the wellness program, it is crucial to consider the ongoing monitoring of risks, costs and progress on initial objectives, within the program design.

The results illustrate a comparison of the varied effects of changes in assumptions on SuperLife’s net present value and profit margin. By comparing the magnitudes of impact, we can rank the variables based on their relative impact on SuperLife’s financials. From greatest to least impact:
1. Intervention program mortality improvements
2. Intervention program costs
3. Sign-up rate
4. Goal meeting rate
5. Interest rate
6. Time horizon for intervention program 

It is important to note that a 1.5% increase in the interest rate assumption forms the ‘best case scenario’ and leads to a 1.18% increase in SuperLife’s profit margin whilst leading to a ~14m decrease in the NPV. The discrepancy in movement is explained by the greater level of discounting and hence, the smaller NPV. However, the EPV of premiums also decreased which led to an overall increase in the profit margin. 

Another discrepancy in the results is the movement in the NPV and profit margin when the ‘goal meeting’ rate was adjusted. The ‘best case scenario’ was defined to be an 80% ‘goal meeting’ rate whilst the ‘worst case scenario’ was defined to be 30%. The results indicate that the ‘best case scenario’ actually led to downward movements in SuperLife’s financials and vice versa. This can be explained through the understanding that if a greater proportion of policyholders meet their goal, SuperLife will have to payout a greater amount as a result of the profit allocation structure of the program.
