## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of the Life Insurance company and can be measured by key metrics including:
- mortality rates of policyholders
- expected policy profits
- new business signups
- expected death payouts

These metrics will be continuously monitored over time, with the program being reviewed every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving these main objectives, and modify the program's features and/or pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
