## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of SuperLife and will be measured by the following key metrics:
<div align="center">

| Key Metric | Frequency |
|------------|-----------|
| Mortality Rates of Policyholders | Annually for first 5 years, then once every 5 years |
| Expected Death Payouts | Annually |
| Number of New Business Signups | Annually |
| Expected Policy Profits & Costs | Annually |
| Satisfaction Rate (Net Promoter Score) | Annually for the first 5 years, then once every 5 years |

</div>

Given these metrics, the wellness program will be reviewed as a whole every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving its main objectives, and modify the program's features and pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
PTCST Consulting developed a comprehensive health incentive program for SuperLife that incentivises participation by offering profit-sharing opportunities.

**Features**

PTCST Consulting’s wellness plan uses a tailored approach whereby each new SuperLife policyholder over the age of 25 will undergo an initial, compulsory health check-up which forms the basis of their personalised health plan. This personalised health plan will include some or all of the listed program features and will be revised each year, based on the results of the policyholder’s annual compulsory health check-up and heart screening:

1.	Annual Health Check-ups:
     - Comprehensive annual health check-up (and immediately for all new policyholders) that provides free or discounted health screenings for various conditions, including blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, and diabetes screenings
     - Used to develop personalised health plan

2.	Heart Health Screenings:
     - Offer to policyholders to gauge risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years
     - Use to develop features of personalised health plan, e.g., following a heart-healthy eating pattern, increasing exercise, maintaining a healthy weight and reducing tobacco use
     - For all policyholders to complete annually upon purchasing a policy

3.	Cancer Prevention Initiatives:
     - Personalised based on policyholder’s lifestyle factors, including diet, tobacco use, physical activity.
     - Offer personalised educational resources on lifestyle improvements and its effect on reducing cancer risk
     - Provide access to genetic testing for policyholders with a family history of cancer

4.	Discounted Gym Memberships:
     - Partner with large franchise gym centres to offer discounted gym memberships to policyholders’ closest local gym
     - Provide access to virtual fitness classes and online workout programs for policyholders who elect to exercise at home

5.	Weight Management Programs:
     - Develop personalised weight management program, with potential aspects of:
         - Dietitian appointments
         - Healthy cooking classes
         - Healthy eating workshops

6.	Safety Campaigns:
     - Provide both general and personalised safety workshops, based on policyholders' profiles, that aim to promote healthy living and injury prevention
     - General workshops and webinars on fire safety, home safety and safe driving
     - Create personalised (i.e., by industry) workplace safety campaigns that offer tips on work stress management, ergonomic practices and key safety techniques, e.g., proper lifting techniques for policyholders with manual labour jobs

**Incentives for Intervention Program**

SuperLife’s incentive scheme is underpinned by a multi-level reward system, where policyholders progress by completing goals in their personalised health plan, e.g. participating in safety workshops. This system is split into five levels, each with different proportions of profit share allocated to policyholders, who start on Level 1 upon sign-up (see _Table A_). 

Each year, in the annual check-up and heart screening, the policyholder will receive certain health goals from the medical practitioner, such as BMI requirements, target heart-rate or ideal cholesterol levels. At the policyholder’s next annual check-up and heart screening:
- If the policyholder has met (not met) the previous policy year’s goals, they move up (down) a level in the incentive scheme structure for the next year. Moving to higher (lower) levels leads to increased (decreased) proportions of profit share.
<div align="center">

|        | **Level 1** | **Level 2** | **Level 3** | **Level 4** | **Level 5** |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Profit Share Allocation** | 10% | 25% | 35% | 45% | 60%|

</div>
<p align="center">
Table A: Profit Share Allocation Structure
</p>

**Other Key Program Requirements**
- Policyholders must agree to participate in initial and annual health and heart check-ups to track personal progress and improvements.
- Policyholders must be committed to making lifestyle changes and implementing healthy habits to improve overall wellness.
- Policyholders must be willing to honestly share their progress with SuperLife to qualify for incentives.
- Policyholders must agree to participate in NPS feedback surveys to provide input and improve the program for future participants.

**Justification of Program Features**:

_Qualitative_:
1.	Lower frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts by…
  - Decreasing Expected Mortality: through the overall development of healthy behaviours, the program aims to reduce the likelihood of
    policyholders’ mortality.
2. Incentivises Healthy Behaviour through…
  - Participation in the Program: material rewards system uses gamification elements, such as progressing to higher reward tiers, to motivate policyholders to make lasting health changes
  - Social support aspect of program features, such as group healthy cooking or exercise classes, encourages engagement and makes it easily
    accessible
3.	Increases SuperLife’s overall profitability by…
  - Increasing Life Insurance Sales: rewards and discounts offered through the program will incentivise participants to purchase SuperLife’s life
    insurance products, thereby increasing sales and revenue
  - Improving Product Marketability and Competitiveness: this holistic health plan will differentiate SuperLife’s offerings in the market, making
    them more attractive to consumers
  - Adding Economic Value to SuperLife: By promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing mortality rates, the program ultimately increases sales,
    customer loyalty and long-term customer relations
    
_Quantitative_:
Intervention Program Selection Methodology conducted to determine the most optimal intervention programs to include (refer to _Figure A_ for visualisations):
1. Sorted program descriptions to maximise impact on mortality rates whilst simultaneously minimising the per capita cost of the scheme
2. Plotted and identified leading causes of death and mapped these to the associated intervention schemes
3. Determined top schemes with maximal impact on mortality rates and minimal per capita cost that can be directly linked to mitigating the leading causes of death

<p align="center">
     Figure A: Death count alongside proportion of ages at death for each cause
</p>

**Justification of Short-and-Long-term Timeframes**
- Short-term timeframe is the 5-year period from 2023 (2023–2028)
  
Evaluating the wellness program within the next 5 years is a sufficient amount of time for SuperLife to start seeing the impact on mortality rates, but not too extensive so as to allow them to adjust the program if needed, based on feedback and results, to ensure it achieves the project goals.

- Long-term timeframe of the 30-year period from 2023 (2023-2053)
  
SuperLife offers products such as whole life, 20- and 30-year term insurance, and universal life products and hence have long-term implications for policyholders. Hence, this timeframe allows Superlife to recognise the long-term benefits in terms of lower mortality rates and higher customer retention.


## Pricing/Costs
**Method**

Summarised below is an overview of PTCST Consulting’s pricing methodology.

_Costs_

Costs were priced according to four main categories: 
1. Expected Payout Costs
2. Intervention Program Costs
3. Incentive Costs
4. Operating Expenses
   
Program costs were determined by sampling participation booleans for each policyholder and intervention program according to the signup rates for each intervention program. The actual costs per year of providing each program to each policyholder were then determined by sampling from a uniform distribution bounded by the lower and upper limits of costs given in the provided data.

Annual expected payout costs were determined by multiplying survival probability to that year by death probability in that year and the policy face amount. The key difference was in the death probability reductions from the intervention programs which were determined by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution. These values were incrementally applied according to the program time horizons listed in the assumptions.

To determine the incentive scheme costs, we first had to simulate which levels policyholders were likely to be at throughout their policies. This was modelled by sampling booleans for whether someone was likely to regularly meet their health goals that were set in their annual checkup or not. If they were, they received the Level 5 benefits, and if they weren’t, they received the Level 1 benefits. In addition to this, as people who are unlikely to meet their health goals are unlikely to be actively taking part in their intervention programs, some of their mortality reductions were removed, such as mortality reductions received from discounted gym memberships.

The operating expenses were derived by considering data provided by APRA on life insurers and their breakdown of costs in Australian insurers. While this data is not completely reliable in estimating costs for Lumaria, using the proportion of operating expenses to policy revenue still provides a workable estimate for understanding our operational costs. 

_Premiums_

Rather than determining premiums and then evaluating policy revenue based on a given premium, each policy was priced by “risk units”. The base number of risk units for a given policyholder was determined using their gender, age, policy type, underwriting class and smoking status. The total number of risk units was found by multiplying their base risk units by the sum insured divided by 1000. This allowed for the price per Č1000 of sum insured for each policyholder to be determined.
By using this method, the total number of risk units in the cohort of policyholders can be determined, with the premium per risk unit later decided to generate a specific profit margin.

**Results**

_Total Economic Costs for Short Term (5 Years) & Long Term (30 Years)_
<p align="center">
     <img src="https://github.com/tmadfouni/SOA2024/assets/85098929/c97f4951-a88a-4947-86e5-4197953b9b65" width="400" alt="image"/>
     <img src="https://github.com/tmadfouni/SOA2024/assets/85098929/d3068cf7-c0d5-4ac3-97ac-7d7f99a1a99d" width="400" alt="image"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
     Figure B: Total Economic Costs for Short Term (5 Years) & Long Term (30 Years)
</p>

From _Figure B_, it can be seen that the total economic costs incurred per year with the wellness program are higher in the first 10 years than the total economic costs incurred without the program. This is expected since there will be initial costs associated with the implementation of the program and the benefits to mortality rates will not be fully realised in the short term. After 10 years, the total economic costs incurred with the program are lower than without the program, which is reflective of the realised decrease in mortality rates.

| With Program Cost Formula  | Without Program Cost Formula |
|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Total Economic Costs (With Program) =  Policy and Other Expenses + Program Expenses + Expected Death Costs | Total Economic Costs (Without Program) =  Policy and Other Expenses + Expected Death Costs |

     <img src="https://github.com/tmadfouni/SOA2024/assets/85098929/056b7f9b-a3ee-4eec-9ba9-2c40b5d77ff3" width="400" alt="image"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
     Figure C: Expected Death Costs for Short Term (5 Years) & Long Term (30 Years)
</p>

_Figure C_ illustrates that the expected annual death costs with the program are consistently lower than that without the program. This difference becomes larger for the first 20 years before we see that the with program costs slowly approach the without program costs. This can be explained by the reduction in mortality, hence postponement of the death of policyholders. This allows premiums to be invested for longer resulting in higher returns.

With regards to possible savings if the program had been implemented 20 years ago, by accumulating all savings to the start of 2024, approximately Č6.46 billion in savings could have been accumulated. It should also be noted that a large proportion of these savings would have been offset by program expenses, but regardless, it demonstrates a high level of possible savings in benefit payouts.

_Revenue for Short Term (5 Years) & Long Term (30 Years)_
<p align="center">
     <img src="https://github.com/tmadfouni/SOA2024/assets/85098929/7a389346-327c-4103-87f4-9bf55e069dce" width="400" alt="image"/>

     Figure D: Revenue for Short Term (5 Years) & Long Term (30 Years). 
     Note: The 2023 revenue values have been hidden out of bounds to improve presentation of the data
</p>

_Figure D_ illustrates that the revenue is very high in the first year due to a proportion of policyholders being modelled to hold Single Premium Whole Life insurance (SPWL). The revenue generated per year for the next 19 years is much lower since they are from T20 policies and due to mortality these values have a decreasing trend before they drop to 0 after the 20 year period. Comparing revenues, it can be seen that more revenue is generated with the program than without. This is due to charging a higher premium reflective of the benefits the program provides to the policyholder.

Finally, a comparison of the profit margins obtained with and without the program is detailed in _Table C_, demonstrating that a higher profit margin is obtained with the program. 
<div align="center">

| Profit Margin With Program | Profit Margin Without Program | Relative Diff in Profit Margin |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 17.47% | 15.40% | 13.41% |

</div>
<p align="center">

</p>

_Sales Optimization_

Premiums were set very generously (for policyholders) without the program and hiked by only 10% with the program. When monitoring the program over the next few years, if sales are below expectations, SuperLife can consider reducing premiums to optimise sales. However, it is vital to note that premiums should only be reduced to a minimum of 1.07037 × (Premiums without the program) to ensure the profit margin remains at par or greater than that without the program.

## Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed on the key variables to assess the financial impact of changes in key assumptions. Ranges of values were determined for each of the above variables, with the theoretical experience assumptions lying within this range. A comparison of the absolute impacts on SuperLife’s net present value and the relative impacts on profit margin for the best and worst case scenarios for each variable was conducted. The profit margin comparison is illustrated in _Figure E_ below.
<p align="center">
     <img src="https://github.com/tmadfouni/SOA2024/assets/85098929/296a8dcd-7e6a-45cf-b919-830adbc5d250" alt="image"/>
</p>
<p align="center">
     Figure E: Sensitivity Analysis - Profit Margin
</p>

Evidently, the effect of the intervention programs on mortality rates will have the largest impact on SuperLife’s profit margin. The outer bounds of each intervention program’s approximate impact on mortality rates was used, where the upper bound generates the best case scenario and the lower bound generates the worst case scenario. Given the results, it is important for SuperLife to closely monitor and update the mortality rate improvement assumptions regularly, as the worst case scenario results in a 14% decrease in the profit margin.

<p align="center">
     Figure F:
</p>

_Figure F_ illustrates a comparison of the distribution of profit margins, where 97.48% of the observations for ‘With Program’ have a higher profit margin than those for ‘Without Program’. This implies that there is a 97.48% degree of certainty that the value of the benefits derived from the program will exceed the value of the benefits derived without the program. Additionally, extending upon the results in Section 3.3 regarding the possible past mortality savings from the program, it can be deduced that there is a high degree of certainty for mortality improvements if the program had been implemented for the past 20 years.

## Data and Data Limitations
**Data Sources**

No external data was used for the analysis. 


**Data Limitations**
| Limitation                   | Explanation                                                                                         |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of homogeneity between insured population vs. general population | The SuperLife Inforce data set (2023 cohort) has been used as a representative sample of payout reduction for prospective policies. However, the selection effects of the differences between the insured population versus the general population may compromise the accuracy of our analysis. |
| Lack of gender differentiation in mortality table data | The discrepancies between female and male life expectancies in reality should be reflected in differences in their mortality rates. However, the mortality table does not distinguish between the two genders and thus, generalises our analysis by combining both genders.|
| Limited past policy data | The truncation of the SuperLife Inforce dataset to 2001 blocks insight into possible longitudinal and cross-sectional trends, thus reducing the precision of future projections by introducing unaccounted variance. |
| Limited data on Lumaria’s population trend | The lack of data on Lumaria’s population trend has made it difficult to extrapolate calculations. This had led to the assumptions of a closed population and a linear trend in mortality improvement. |
| No data on policy premiums | Exact policy premiums were not provided. Hence, premiums were estimated based on the Principle of Equivalence, which compromises the accuracy of the estimated cash inflows. |
| Historical economic data | Historical inflation rates, interest rates and spot rates were used to project future rates, thus compromising the accuracy of projected future revenue and costs. |

## Further Recommendations
It is essential to ensure the wellness program is easily accessible to policyholders to ensure full health benefits and optimal satisfaction. SuperLife must ensure that the wellness program does not unfairly discriminate against policyholders based on factors such as age, gender, or location. SuperLife may consider offering virtual or online resources as a reasonable location adjustment, such as mobile apps, telehealth services, or virtual wellness events. 

The use of policyholder data to evaluate the impact of the wellness program is essential for measuring effectiveness and making informed decisions for future improvements. However, for ethical purposes, SuperLife should consider implementing transparent data collecting and analysis processes, with data only being used to measure the effectiveness of the program and make improvements for the future benefit of policyholders. 

Furthermore, to ensure compliance with consumer protection laws, SuperLife should consider providing clear information about the program, including costs, benefits and potential risks to policyholders, and not engage in unfair or deceptive practices. Ongoing reporting, monitoring of reserves and regular cost updates to regulators should be provided to ensure compliance.

## Conclusion
The proposed wellness intervention program can help SuperLife improve its policyholders’ expected mortality whilst also achieving increased profitability (with a 97.48% degree of certainty). The expected increase in the profit margin is 13.41% relative to the profit margin without the program. After thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses on its impact over short and long-term timeframes, the associated financial and social benefits provide substantial evidence that the project should be undertaken. However, it is crucial to perform ongoing monitoring of risks, costs and progress on initial objectives.
