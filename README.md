## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of the Life Insurance company and can be measured by key metrics including:
- mortality rates of policyholders
- expected policy profits
- new business signups
- expected death payouts

These metrics will be continuously monitored over time, with the program being reviewed every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving these main objectives, and modify the program's features and/or pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
PTCST Consulting developed a comprehensive health incentive program for SuperLife that incentivises participation by offering external benefits through a rewards scheme, and policy-related benefits through premium reductions.

**Features**
Taking a more personalised approach to the wellness plan, each new policyholder over the age of 25 will undergo an initial, compulsory health and heart check-up, that will form the basis of their personalised health plan. This personalised health plan will include some or all of the following program features, and will be revised each year, based on the results of the policyholder’s annual health check-up:

1.	Annual Health Check-ups:
  - Comprehensive annual health check-up (and immediately for all new policyholders) that provides free or discounted health screenings for various conditions, including blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, and diabetes screenings
  - Used to develop personalised health plan

2.	Heart Health Screenings:
  - Offer to policyholders to gauge risk of a heart attack or stroke in the next 5 years
    - Use to develop features of personalised health plan, e.g., following a heart-healthy eating pattern, increasing exercise, maintaining a
      healthy weight and reducing tobacco use
  - For all policyholder ages to complete annually upon purchasing a policy

3.	Cancer Prevention Initiatives:
  - Personalised based on policyholder’s lifestyle factors, including diet, tobacco use, physical activity.
    - offer personalised educational resources on lifestyle improvements and its effect on reducing cancer risk
  - Provide access to genetic testing for policyholders with a family history of cancer

4.	Discounted Gym Memberships:
  - Partner with large franchise gym centres to offer discounted gym memberships to policyholders’ closest local gym
  - Provide access to virtual fitness classes and online workout programs for policyholders who elect to exercise at home

5.	Weight Management Programs:
  - Develop personalised weight management program, with potential aspects of:
    - Dietitian appointments
    - Healthy cooking classes
    - Healthy eating workshops

6.	Safety Campaigns:
  - Provide both general and personalised safety workshops, based on policyholder’s profile, that aim to promote healthy living and injury
    prevention
  - General workshops and webinars on fire safety, home safety and safe driving
  - Create personalised (i.e., by industry) workplace safety campaigns that offers tips on work stress management, ergonomic practices and key
    safety techniques, e.g., proper lifting techniques for policyholders with manual labour jobs

**Incentives for Intervention Program**

SuperLife’s incentive scheme will be underpinned by a multi-level reward system, where policyholders progress for participating in features of their personalised health plan, such as participating in safety workshops and healthy eating workshops.

This system is split into two reward categories, each with five levels, with policyholders starting on Level 1 upon signup:
1. Subsidies on Interventions: increasing proportion of intervention program costs (in policyholder wellness plans), covered by SuperLife      as policyholders progress to higher levels
   - Policyholders will only receive subsidies for the first 5 years of policy
2. Premium Discounts: increasing discounts applied to policyholder premiums of SuperLife policies as policyholders progress to higher levels
   - Only applies after the policyholder is enrolled and participating in wellness program for at least 5 years

Each year, in the annual check-up, the policyholder will receive certain health goals from the medical practitioner, such as BMI requirements, heart rate, cholesterol levels, etc.
At the next annual check-up (based on policy inception date):
- If the policyholder has met the previous policy year’s goals, they move up a level for the next year.
- If the policyholder has not met the previous policy year’s goals, they move down a level.
At this point, revised goals for the upcoming policy year will be determined by the medical practitioner, and this cycle will repeat.

PLOT

**Justification of Program Features**:

_Qualitative_:
1.	Lower frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts by…
  - Decreasing Expected Mortality: through the overall development of healthy behaviours, the program aims to reduce the likelihood of
    policyholders’ mortality.
2. Incentivises Healthy Behaviour through…
  - Participation in the Program: material rewards system uses gamification elements, such as progressing to higher reward tiers, to motivates
    policyholders to make lasting health changes
  - social support aspect of program features, such as group healthy cooking or exercise classes, encourages engagement and make it easily
    accessible
3.	Increases SuperLife’s overall profitability by…
  - Increasing Life Insurance Sales: rewards and discounts offered through the program will incentivise participants to purchase SuperLife’s life
    insurance products, thereby increasing sales and revenue
  - Improving Product Marketability and Competitiveness: this holistic health plan will differentiate SuperLife’s offerings in the market, making
    them more attractive to consumers
  - Adding Economic Value to SuperLife: By promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing mortality rates, the program ultimately increases sales,
    customer loyalty and long-term customer relations
    
_Quantitative_:
Intervention Program Selection Methodology:
1. Sorted program descriptions (in given data) to maximise impact on mortality rates whilst simultaneously minimising per capita cost of the scheme
2. Plotted and identified leading causes of death (using given data) and mapped these to the associated intervention schemes
3. Determined top schemes with maximal impact on mortality rates and minimal per capita cost that can be directly linked to mitigate the leading causes of death
(refer to Appendix – add plot, Excel table, risk quadrant)

**Justification of Short-and-Long-term Timeframes**
- Short-term timeframe is the 5-year period from 2023 (2023–2028)
Evaluating the wellness program within the next 5 years is a sufficient amount of time for Superlife to start seeing the impact on mortality rates, but not too extensive so as to allow them to adjust the program if needed, based on feedback and results, to ensure it achieves the project goals.
- Long-term timeframe of the 30-year period from 2023 (2023-2053)
SuperLife offers products such as whole life, 20- and 30-year term insurance, and universal life products and hence have long-term implications for policyholders. Hence, this timeframe allows Superlife to recognise the long-term benefits in terms of lower mortality rates and higher customer retention.

**Qualitative Risks (L)**
| Risk | Explanation | Risk Matrix Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| L1. Program may be perceived as intrusive | Policyholders may feel that SuperLife’s access to their health data and the level of monitoring is intrusive leading to potential customers hesitating to purchase a life insurance policy with them. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensuring there is transparency surrounding what health data will be used and how individuals will be monitored.</li><li>Ensuring that only the minimum required data is collected to complete the required work.</li><li>Providing options for policyholders to refrain from sharing certain data if they would like to keep it private.</li><li>Emphasising the benefits of participating so that they know their data is being used in their best interests</li></ul>|
| L2. Dependence on Technology | It is likely that there will be a lot of technology used for monitoring purposes throughout the program. Some policyholders (e.g., the elderly population) may not have sufficient digital literacy leading to accessibility issues amongst different age groups. | 20 (Very High) | <ul><li>Provide good customer service and technology support.</li><li>Ensure a user friendly interface and clear instructions.</li></ul>|
| L3. Exploitation of loopholes | Policyholders may exploit loopholes in the health program if monitoring is not stringent enough or if the completion of the program activities are easy to forge. E.g., if there is a daily requirement of 1000 steps, the policyholder could just attach their step counter device to their dog. | 6 (Moderate) | <ul><li>Define clear rules and criteria regarding what constitutes the completion/progression of the health program.</li><li>Carefully consider possible loopholes when developing the healthcare plan.</li><li>Monitor policyholder engagement patterns and investigate any suspicious activity.</li></ul>|
| L4. Regulatory Compliance Risk | Using policyholder health data and constant health monitoring to determine e.g., premium reductions may be violating Lumarian regulations. | 20 (High) | <ul><li>Utilise regulatory and legal advisors whilst developing the program to ensure there is compliance to all relevant laws.</li><li>Conduct frequent audits to ensure ongoing compliance especially when there are changes to regulations.</li></ul>|
| L5. Employee Resistance | Implementing a health program like this would require more work from employees since there would be more inquiries from policyholders and more information would need to be provided to customers. This concept is new so it would take quite a bit of work on the employees’ part to help customers understand and feel secure. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Since more employees will need to be hired, make sure to hire individuals who are supportive of the program and its objectives.</li><li>Provide comprehensive training, guidance and resources so that they understand the program and its benefits.</li><li>Incentivise frontline workers to promote the new products.</li></ul>|
| L6. Policyholders not adopting healthy behaviours | The policyholders may not adopt healthy behaviours in which case the program wouldn’t be that effective and the high initial costs to implement the program may not be compensated by decreased mortality in the future. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensure participation incentives are sufficient to motivate participation. This could be done by conducting surveys and exploring existing data from other health care plans.</li><li>Providing tailored programs taking into account barriers to change and mitigating those accordingly.</li><li>Ensure that the policyholder understands the short and long term benefits of adherence.</li></ul>|
| L7. Competitive Rivalry | Other insurance companies may implement similar health programs creating competition for SuperLife. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Ensure that the program being provided by SuperLife has some differentiating aspect that isn’t easy to replicate, e.g., SuperLife could have an exclusive supply partnership with some other companies to provide unique incentives to policyholders.</li><li>Monitor the competition landscape continuously and ensure the program continues to have a differentiating factor and is reasonably priced.</li></ul>|
| L8. Privacy Concerns | There is risk of privacy being breached. | 16 (Very High) | <ul><li>Ensure compliance with the relevant regulators. </li><li>Conduct frequent audits.</li><li>Create appropriate access controls and encryption.</li><li>Only collect the minimum data necessary to complete the required work.</li></ul>|

**Quantitative Risks (T)**
| Risk | Explanation | Risk Matrix Score | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-------------------|------------|
| T1. Underestimation of Program Costs | The total initial and ongoing costs of the program may be underestimated leading to unforeseen expenses and challenges to maintain the program. | 12 (High) | <ul><li>Conduct thorough analysis of all potential costs including admin, incentive payouts, marketing, new employee salaries, training, etc.</li><li>Regularly update cost projections depending on inflation.</li><li>Ensure there are reserves to buffer unexpected costs.</li><li>Conduct sensitivity analysis to determine what would be an appropriate amount of reserves.</li></ul>| 
| T2. Inaccurate Health Assessments (Counterparty Risk) | There is a possibility that third-party vendors and healthcare providers conduct inaccurate health assessments leading to mispricing of premiums or not providing the most effective incentives. | 8 (High) | <ul><li>Conduct due diligence on selected counterparty’s experience and expertise.</li><li>Define clear performance metrics.</li><li>Monitor and audit the performance of the counterparty.</li></ul>| 
| T3. Adverse Selection | Individuals with higher health risks may be more likely to sign up to the program leading to higher claims and increased losses to SuperLife. | 16 (Very High) | <ul><li>Ensure high risk individuals are filtered out during the health assessment process using well defined underwriting guidelines.</li><li>Monitor the risk profile of individuals and make sure to adjust their premiums and incentives accordingly.</li></ul>| 
| T4. Model Selection Risk | Potentially selecting an inadequate modelling for projecting the program outcomes leading to inaccurate predictions or biases. | 9 (High) | <ul><li>Understand the data and use suitable assumptions.</li><li>Compare models.</li><li>Evaluate model performance using metrics such as AIC/BIC and R-squared.</li><li>Update assumptions and model as the program evolves.</li></ul>| 
| T5. Economic Assumptions Risk | Economic factors such as inflation and interest rates can be highly volatile. Because of this, any assumptions about these rates are likely to be incorrect leading to false projections and revenue forecasts. | 25 (Very High) | <ul><li>Assume constant inflation and interest rate since the high volatility of these factors means there is no added benefit or projecting these.</li><li>Conduct sensitivity analysis to assess economic scenario impact.</li><li>Regularly update economic assumptions.</li></ul>|
| T6. Liquidity Risk | There may be inadequate liquidity to fund payouts and meet other financial obligations especially during the first few years of implementing the program. | 15 (Very High) | <ul><li>Conduct stress testing and cash-flow analysis.</li><li>Organise contingency funding arrangements e.g., reinsurance.</li><li>Monitor liquidity metrics regularly.</li></ul>|
