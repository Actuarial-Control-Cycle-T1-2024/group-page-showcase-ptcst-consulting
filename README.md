## Executive Summary
## Objectives
The main objectives of the proposed program are to: 
1. Reduce the frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts for the company
2. Incentivise healthier behaviours of policyholders

These two objectives work together to increase the profitability of the Life Insurance company and can be measured by key metrics including:
- mortality rates of policyholders
- expected policy profits
- new business signups
- expected death payouts

These metrics will be continuously monitored over time, with the program being reviewed every 5 years to assess whether it is still achieving these main objectives, and modify the program's features and/or pricing if necessary.

## Program Design
PTCST Consulting developed a comprehensive health incentive program for SuperLife that incentivises participation by offering external benefits through a rewards scheme, and policy-related benefits through premium reductions.

To achieve the project objectives, the program will be designed with the following features:
1. _Safety Campaigns_:
- Implement annual workplace safety training program for policyholders who are employed, e.g., fire drills, evacuation exercises
  - Tailor to policyholders’ different workplaces
- Home safety questionnaire to be completed upon policyholder sign-up
- Offer to businesses with significant workplace hazards, discounts on safety equipment such as helmets, reflective vests, and safety harnesses
- Compulsory safety modules upon purchasing a policy
2. _Annual Health Check-ups_: 
- Provide free or discounted health screenings for policyholders, including blood pressure checks, cholesterol tests, and diabetes screenings
- Offer policyholders personalised health reports based on annual check-up results, highlighting areas of improvement and providing resources for healthy lifestyle changes
3. _Discounted Gym Memberships_: 
- Partner with large franchise gym centres to offer discounted gym memberships to policyholders’ closest local gym
  - renewal upon proof of membership use
- Provide access to virtual fitness classes and online workout programs for policyholders who prefer to exercise at home
- Offer incentives for policyholders who meet fitness goals:
  - reduced premiums
  - gift cards to fitness-related stores
4. _Weight Management Programs_: 
- Provide disocunted dietitian appointments/nutrition counselling and meal planning resources for policyholders to improve their eating habits
5. _Cancer Prevention Initiatives_: 
- Offer educational resources on cancer prevention upon sign-up, including information on screening guidelines, healthy lifestyle choices, and risk factors
- Provide access to genetic testing for policyholders with a family history of cancer
6. _Heart Health Screenings_:
For all policyholder ages to complete annually upon purchasing a policy
- Annual accumulating discount for each checkup completed
- Failure to complete checkup restarts discount at lowest band

Ways it will achieve the project objectives:
1. Lower frequency and severity of life insurance claim payouts:
  - Decrease Expected Mortality: By regular preventative health screenings, and through the overall development of healthy behaviours, the program aims to reduce the likelihood of premature death and decrease expected mortality rates of policyholders.
  - Increase Life Insurance Sales: The rewards and discounts offered through the program will incentivize participants to purchase SuperLife’s life insurance products, thereby increasing sales and revenue through new business.
  - Improve Product Marketability and Competitiveness: A comprehensive health incentive program will differentiate SuperLife’s offerings in the market, making them more attractive to consumers, hence creating a competitive advantage.
  - Add Economic Value to SuperLife: By promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing mortality rates, the program will ultimately add economic value to SuperLife through increased sales, customer loyalty, and improved overall profitability.

3. Incentivises Healthy Behaviour: The rewards system aims to motivate policyholders to participate in the program schemes in exchange for points that can be used to redeem cash or gift cards of well-known brands
  - indirectly encourages engagement in healthy activities, resulting in improved overall health outcomes.

### Appendix A: Intervention Program Selection Methdology 
1. Sorted ​​program descriptions (in given data) to maximise impact on mortality rates whilst simultaneously minimising per capita cost of the scheme
2. Plotted and identified leading causes of death (using given data) and mapped these to the associated intervention schemes
3. Determined top schemes with maximal impact on mortality rates and minimal per capita cost that can be directly linked to mitigate the leading causes of death
